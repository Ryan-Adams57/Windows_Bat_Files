Five useful scripts you can add to your toolset:

Fix-OS-Corruption

A reliable way to resolve Windows issues by running the built-in Windows repair tools in the correct order.

GPUpdateFullFIX.bat

Use this when a Windows PC fails to receive Group Policy settings from its domain controller. It runs all the steps typically required on a workstation to successfully refresh Group Policy—far more comprehensive than a simple gpupdate /force.

RESET_IE.bat

Resets Internet Explorer settings to their defaults, helping resolve common browser-related issues.

Reset_Password.bat

Resets a local Windows user password when standard methods are unavailable.

Reset_Windows_Update.bat

Clears and resets Windows Update components to fix common update failures.
