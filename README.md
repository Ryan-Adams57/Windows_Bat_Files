What this script does:

The script will prompt you to enter the username and new password.

It uses the net user command to reset the password for the specified user account.

3. Reset Internet Explorer (IE).

Explanation:

@ECHO OFF: This turns off the display of commands in the command prompt window.

RunDll32.exe InetCpl.cpl,ResetIEtoDefaults: This command calls a Windows system utility (RunDll32.exe) to reset Internet Explorer settings to their defaults.

The InetCpl.cpl is the control panel applet for Internet Explorer settings, and ResetIEtoDefaults is the function that performs the reset.

PAUSE: This keeps the command prompt window open after the script runs so you can see any messages before the window closes.

You would see "Press any key to continue..." which allows you to press a key and close the window.

When to Use:

This script is great for a quick reset of Internet Explorer's settings, including:

Default home page

Search engine settings

SSL and security settings
